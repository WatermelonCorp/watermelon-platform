# AI Usage Policy

This project welcomes contributions that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), but we require that all such contributions be carefully reviewed and vetted by the submitter.

Watermelon Platform aims to provide high quality, performant, and secure React components. AI can help you write code faster, but it is not a substitute for responsibility.

## Code of Conduct for AI-Generated Contributions

1. **Responsibility**: By submitting code generated in whole or in part by an AI, you confirm that you have read, understood, and tested the code. You remain strictly responsible for any bugs, architectural flaws, licensing issues, or vulnerabilities introduced by the code.
2. **Review and Verification**: Ensure AI-generated code meets the project's quality standards, styling guidelines (e.g., shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS 4), and architectural patterns. Tests and local builds must pass.
3. **Plagiarism & Licensing**: AI tools can sometimes reproduce snippets of copyrighted material. You must ensure the contributed code does not violate any third-party licenses or infringe upon copyrighted works.
4. **Transparency**: While you don't need to specify every single line written by Copilot, if an entire complex algorithm, file, or architectural change was primarily generated with an LLM, please mention it in your Pull Request description. This helps reviewers understand the context of the contribution.

We embrace AI as a helpful developer tool, rather than a substitute for human craftsmanship and accountability. Thank you for contributing responsibly to Watermelon Platform!
