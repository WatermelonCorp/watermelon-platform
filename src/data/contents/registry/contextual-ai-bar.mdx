# Contextual AI Bar

A sophisticated, state-aware action bar designed for AI-integrated interfaces. It features a tactile toggle that switches the bar's entire context—from a tool-focused shortcut bar to a natural language AI input.

- **Fluid Morphing Transitions**: Leverages Framer Motion's shared layout capabilities to seamlessly expand and collapse the bar while transiting between tools and text entry.
- **State-Aware Pill Toggle**: Includes a persistent, high-contrast toggle with active state highlighting that drives the bar's functionality.
- **Micro-Interaction Staggering**: Icons and inputs enter using spring-based motion for a responsive, high-end feel.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Crafted with a semi-transparent blur background, subtle borders, and balanced shadows for a modern "glassmorphism" look.
- **Tactile Inputs**: Features a dedicated execution button with hover and tap feedback, perfectly aligned with the AI input field.
