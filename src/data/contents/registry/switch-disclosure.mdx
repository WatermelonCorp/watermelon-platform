# Switch Disclosure

A high-fidelity configuration component designed for complex settings and feature toggles. It provides a tactile primary switch that reveals nested options with seamless layout animations, creating a clean and organized user experience.

- **Primary Toggle Control**: Features a sophisticated switch with smooth, spring-based knob motion and color-adaptive states (`#EE2563` on active).
- **Animated Nested Options**: Leverages `AnimatePresence` and `layout` props to smoothly reveal sub-options while naturally adjusting the parent container's height.
- **Micro-Interaction Checkbox**: A custom-designed checkbox with fluid scale and opacity transitions, providing clear visual feedback for sub-settings.
- **Premium Design System**: Built with high-contrast color tokens (`#F6F5FA`, `#ADACB8`) and elegant rounded corners (`26px`) for a modern, OS-level feel.
- **Responsive & Modal-less**: Optimized for narrow layouts, performing as a compact inline settings group that preserves user context.
