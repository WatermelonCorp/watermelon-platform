# Swap Form

A premium authentication component that handles the transition between Sign In and Create Account states with organic motion and high-end visual polish.

- **Dynamic Blurring Transitions**: Uses Framer Motion's `filter` prop to create a soft blurring effect during state changes, making the transition feel fluid and modern.
- **Theme Adaptive UI**: Fully integrated with both light and dark modes, utilizing a refined color palette for borders, backgrounds, and text.
- **Micro-animations**: Tactile button responses and spring-based scaling effects that provide immediate feedback and a premium "OS-level" feel.
- **Social Integration**: Ready-to-use Google and Apple authentication buttons with consistent styling.
- **AnimatePresence Logic**: Leverages `mode="wait"` to ensure clear, sequential state transitions without layout overlaps.
