## Introduction

A high-performance command palette designed for rapid navigation and action execution. It features sectioned results, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, and fluid spring animations for a premium user experience.

## Features

- **Sectioned Results**: Automatically groups commands into categories like Suggestions, Settings, and Help for better organization.
- **Keyboard First**: Full keyboard navigation support (arrows to navigate, Enter to select, Esc to close) and customizable shortcuts.
- **Spring Animations**: Uses `framer-motion` spring physics for natural-feeling entry, exit, and layout transitions.
- **Dynamic Search**: Real-time filtering of commands with smooth layout animations as the list updates.
- **Backdrop Blur**: Premium frosted-glass effect for the overlay to maintain context while focusing on the search.
- **Adaptive Layout**: Responsive design that works well across different screen sizes with a custom scrollbar for long lists.
