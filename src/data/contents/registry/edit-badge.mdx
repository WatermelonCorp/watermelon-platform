# Edit Badge

A high-fidelity interactive badge component designed for seamless status management. It features a modal-less inline editor that allows users to rapidly adjust labels, icons, and themes with fluid motion.

- **Inline Modal-less Editor**: Transitions from a compact badge to a feature-rich editing interface without lost context, using shared layout animations.
- **Shared Layout Transitions**: Icons and containers morph smoothly between the display and editing states using `LayoutGroup`.
- **Dynamic Color & Icon Swatches**: Includes a curated palette of premium background and text color tokens, paired with a tactile icon selector.
- **Spring-Based Physics**: Optimized transitions (`stiffness: 400, damping: 30`) provide a snappy, responsive feel that mimics physical interactions.
- **Micro-Interaction Feedback**: Real-time validation and visual styling updates ensure the editor feels alive and reactive to user input.
