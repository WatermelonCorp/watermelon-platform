# Split Button

A polished multi-action button that expands into contextual options using smooth spring animations. Designed for modern dashboards where primary actions branch into quick secondary choices.

- **Fluid Expansion**: Main CTA morphs into an action row using `motion/react` layout animations.
- **Spring Physics**: High-bounce spring configuration for a premium tactile feel.
- **Blur Morphing**: Uses blur + scale transitions for organic state changes.
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Maintains focus and pointer safety during transitions.
- **Theme Adaptive**: Works seamlessly in light and dark modes.
