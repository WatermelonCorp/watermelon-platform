# macOS Sidebar

A polished, macOS-inspired sidebar built for modern dashboards. It features fluid width transitions, layout-aware hover states, and clean selection feedback for a premium desktop-like experience.

- **Spring Width Animation**: Smooth open/close behavior powered by `motion/react`.
- **Layout-Aware Hover**: Shared layout hover background for organic movement.
- **Selection Feedback**: Active item highlight with subtle fade transitions.
- **Blur-Based Reveal**: Content softly fades and sharpens when expanding.
- **Theme Adaptive**: Carefully tuned for both light and dark interfaces.
