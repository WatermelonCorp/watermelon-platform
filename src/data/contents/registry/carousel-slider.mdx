# Carousel Slider

A tactile, gesture-driven carousel component that uses motion physics to create a playful card-swapping experience. It's designed for showcasing images or content with a deeply satisfying interaction.

- **Gesture-Based Navigation**: Swipe left or right to navigate through slides with velocity-based rotations and offsets.
- **Dynamic Perspective**: Combines rotation, scaling, and z-index transitions to create a realistic "stack" effect.
- **Spring Physics**: Built on Framer Motion's spring systems for smooth, organic movement that responds instantly to user input.
- **Micro-interactions**: Features a floating favourite button with backdrop blur and animated pagination dots.
- **Highly Responsive**: Automatically scales and adjusts its orientation for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices.
