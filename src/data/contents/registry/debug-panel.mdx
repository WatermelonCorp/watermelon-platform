## Introduction

The `DebugPannel` is a specialized developer utility designed for real-time interaction monitoring. It provides immediate visual feedback for user inputs, making it an essential tool for debugging complex motion systems and event handlers in a premium dashboard environment.

## Features

- **Interactive Mouse Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of X/Y coordinates using high-performance `useMotionValue`.
- **Global Event Listeners**: Tracks keyboard activity across the entire window for comprehensive input debugging.
- **Session State Tracking**: Integrated click counter for monitoring user engagement and interaction frequency.
- **Minimalist Aesthetics**: Clean, monochrome developer interface that blends into any workspace.
- **Configurable Toggles**: Granular control over tracking features (Mouse, Keys, Clicks) via component props.
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Robust TypeScript support for all interactive properties and panel modes.
