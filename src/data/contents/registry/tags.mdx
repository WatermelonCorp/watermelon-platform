# Tags

A dynamic, interactable tag management component. It features smooth shared-layout transitions and an auto-scrolling horizontal bar for selected tags, providing a highly tactile and responsive user experience.

- **Shared Layout Transitions**: Items seamlessly animate between the "Available" grid and the "Selected" horizontal bar using Framer Motion's `layoutId`.
- **Auto-Scrolling Selected Bar**: Automatically scrolls to the end when a new tag is added, ensuring the latest selection is always visible.
- **Micro-Animations**: Uses layout animations for smooth repositioning and scaling when tags are added or removed.
- **Theme-Adaptive Visuals**: Perfectly tailored for both light and dark modes with sophisticated border and shadow treatments.
- **Highly Responsive**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop with a focus on ease of interaction.
