# Weight Widget

A premium, interactive sliding scale component built for precise numerical input. Designed with physics-based movement and tactile feedback in mind.

## Features

- **Tactile Sliding Scale**: Smooth, momentum-based dragging for an intuitive user experience.
- **Physics-Based Snapping**: Uses spring physics to snap to the nearest unit with elegant deceleration.
- **Dynamic Color Interpolation**: Numbers and tick marks smoothly transition colors as they move towards the center indicator.
- **3D Rotation Effect**: Dial items rotate slightly along a circular path as they are scrolled, mimicking a physical dial.
- **Tailwind Dark Mode**: Fully integrated with system-wide dark mode support using `dark:` utility classes.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Elegant gradients and blurs for a focused, high-end measurement feel.
