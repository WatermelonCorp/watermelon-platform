## Introduction

The `useLoop` hook provides a reliable interval-based state machine for cycling through arrays of content. When paired with the `LoopHook` component, it enables elegant "tik-tik" style vertical scrolling animations with full control over timing and layout persistence.

## Features

- **Custom useLoop Hook**: A lightweight, efficient hook that manages the timing and state of your content cycles.
- **Vertical Content Cycling**: Smooth vertical slide transitions powered by `motion` for high-impact typography.
- **Layout Persistence**: Optimized for the `popLayout` transition mode to prevent structural shifts during rapid cycles.
- **Configurable Delays**: Fine-grained control over the loop interval to match your brand's rhythm and pace.
- **Premium Backdrop**: Integrated with a sophisticated guide-line aesthetic for modern landing pages.
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript for reliable prop handling and array-based content management.
