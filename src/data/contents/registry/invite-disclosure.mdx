# Invite Disclosure

A premium, morphing disclosure component designed for managing invitations, notifications, or lists. It features a tactile "pill" trigger that seamlessly expands into a detailed panel with smooth spring physics.

- **Morphing Layout Transitions**: Uses Framer Motion's `layoutId` to smoothly transition from a compact button to a comprehensive panel.
- **Interactive Badge Pulsing**: Features a high-contrast badge for notification counts, integrated directly into the layout animation.
- **Micro-Interaction Staggering**: Items within the panel enter with a staggered spring animation, creating a polished, professional feel.
- **Subtle Visual Feedback**: Includes refined hover states, rounded corners that adapt during expansion, and backdrop-friendly shadows.
- **Theme-Adaptive Visuals**: Optimized for seamless integration into diverse UI environments with a clean, neutral aesthetic.
