## Introduction

Choice chips that react with personality. When a user selects an interest, the corresponding emoji explodes outward in a playful "spree," providing immediate and satisfying tactile feedback.

## Features

- **Emoji Particles**: Dynamic particle system using `motion/react` that spawns emojis from the click point.
- **Adaptive Layout**: Staggered grid that flows naturally on different screen sizes.
- **Premium Micro-interactions**: Smooth scaling and rotation animations for a tactile feel.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Floating counter badge that tracks selections with a slide-up animation.
- **Tailwind Dark Mode**: Seamlessly integrates with system themes using `dark:` utilities.
- **Spring Physics**: High-performance animations using spring dynamics for a natural feel.
