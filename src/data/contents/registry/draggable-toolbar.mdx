## Introduction

A premium draggable interface element designed for secondary actions or persistent tool access. It features intelligent side-snapping, a collision-aware "Drop to Close" zone, and smooth spring-based animations.

## Features

- **Side-Snapping Logic**: Automatically snaps to the nearest horizontal edge when released, keeping the viewport tidy.
- **Dynamic Tooltips**: Adaptive labels that flip orientation based on the toolbar's position relative to the screen center.
- **Collision-Based Closing**: A unique "X" drop zone appears during drag, providing a tactile way to dismiss the component.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Visual pulse effects and scale transformations that respond to proximity and interaction.
- **Spring Physics**: Powered by `motion` for fluid, momentum-based movement and natural-feeling transitions.
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Sophisticated dark aesthetics with subtle borders and shadows optimized for modern interfaces.
