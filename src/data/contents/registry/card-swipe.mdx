# Card Swipe

A premium, gesture-friendly carousel component that brings a tactile "Tinder-style" interaction to your UI. It's built for high-performance mobile and desktop browsing.

- **Velocity-Based Swiping**: Uses motion physics to calculate swipe power—meaning the faster you flick, the more responsive the transition feels.
- **Organic Motion Path**: Combines rotation, scaling, and blurring effects using Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` to create a deeply satisfying card swap experience.
- **Theme-Adaptive Visuals**: Automatically adapts border weights, shadow densities, and icon colors for both light and dark modes.
- **Interactive Pagination**: Features animated dot indicators that allow both sequential swiping and direct navigation to any card.
- **Highly Customizable**: Easily pass custom data structures and icons while maintaining the core interaction logic.
