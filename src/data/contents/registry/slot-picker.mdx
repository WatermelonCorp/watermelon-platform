# Slot Picker

A sophisticated scheduling tool designed for managing complex time slot availability. It features a tactile interface with smooth layout transitions and organic feedback.

- **Dynamic Slot Management**: Add or remove multiple time slots per day with fluid `AnimatePresence` transitions.
- **Spring-Based Animations**: Built using `motion/react` with high-stiffness spring configurations for a snappy and responsive feel.
- **Layout Morphing**: Uses `LayoutGroup` to ensure all elements animate smoothly when toggling days or changing contents.
- **Theme-Adaptive Visuals**: Perfectly tailored for both light and dark modes with subtle border treatments and shadow depths.
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Designed with focus states and intuitive interaction patterns for efficient scheduling.
