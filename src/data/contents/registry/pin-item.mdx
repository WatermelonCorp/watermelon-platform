# Pin Item

A premium list interaction component that leverages shared-layout animations to seamlessly transition items between "Pinned" and "Default" states.

- **Shared Layout Transitions**: Items move between categories with fluid, interpolated paths, maintaining visual continuousness.
- **Adaptive Priority Sections**: Automatically generates and collapses the "Pinned Places" section based on user interaction.
- **Micro-Interaction Pin Toggle**: Features a tactile, spring-based pin button that reveals on hover and scales during state changes.
- **Depth-Based Visuals**: Cards use subtle drop-shadows and border refinements to create a layered, modern aesthetic.
- **Unified Spring Physics**: All transitions share a central spring configuration (`stiffness: 300, damping: 30`) for a responsive, organic feel.
