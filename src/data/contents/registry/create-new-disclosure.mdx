# Create New Disclosure

A modern and interactive disclosure component designed for "Create New" actions. It starts as a compact, pill-shaped button and expands with a smooth spring animation into a 3-column grid of customizable action items. It uses `motion/react` for fluid layout transitions and a blur-in effect for the content.
