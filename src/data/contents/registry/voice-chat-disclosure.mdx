# Voice Chat Disclosure

A premium, interactive disclosure component designed for voice chat islands or status indicators. It features a sleek "pill" state that smoothly expands into a detailed participant card.

- **Seamless Layout Transitions**: Uses Framer Motion's `layoutId` to morph from a compact pill with avatar stacking into a full-width card.
- **Animated Voice Indicators**: Real-time visual feedback with bar-style voice animations for active participants.
- **Avatar Stacking Logic**: Automatically stacks avatars in the collapsed state with a "+N" indicator for hidden participants.
- **Theme-Adaptive Design**: Perfectly tailored for both light and dark modes with sophisticated border and shadow treatments.
- **Interactive Action States**: Includes a join/leave CTA with micro-animations and custom helper text.
