# Inline Edit

A premium, state-driven editing component designed for clean interfaces. It provides an "edit-in-place" experience with zero layout jarring.

- **Zero-Jar Layout Transitions**: Uses Framer Motion's `layout` prop to ensure that switching between text and input fields is fluid and organic.
- **Multimodal Inputs**: Supports single-line text, multiline textareas, and specialized time-range inputs.
- **Contextual Visual Cues**: Subtle hover effects and icon-swaps guide the user toward editable areas without cluttering the UI.
- **Micro-interactions**: High-stiffness spring animations for buttons and state transitions, providing a tactile, high-end feel.
- **Dark Mode Native**: Built with a color palette that adapts perfectly to both light and dark themes.
