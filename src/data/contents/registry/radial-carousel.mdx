# Radial Carousel

A sophisticated gallery component that arranges items in an interactive radial layout. It features fluid spring-based animations and a seamless transition between a compact focus view and an expanded circular orientation.

- **Interactive Radial Layout**: Items are dynamically positioned along a circular path, creating a unique and engaging gallery experience.
- **Spring-Powered Motion**: Driven by `motion/react` spring physics for buttery-smooth rotations and transitions.
- **Drag-to-Rotate Interaction**: Intuitive manual control allowed through pan gestures, enabling users to spin the carousel freely.
- **Adaptive Viewing Experience**: Effortlessly switches between a focused center display and an exploratory radial expanded state.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Crafted with delicate borders, deep shadows, and theme-adaptive states for a high-end feel.
