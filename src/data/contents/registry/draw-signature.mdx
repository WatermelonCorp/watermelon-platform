# Draw Signature

A high-fidelity signature capture component designed for seamless user consent and authorization flows. It provides a tactile drawing experience that transitions between workflow states with elegant animations, creating a professional and polished signing process.

- **Adaptive Signature Pad**: A touch-responsive canvas that captures fluid strokes with high precision, featuring a theme-aware custom pen cursor.
- **Theme-Aware Experience**: Fully integrated with `next-themes`, automatically adjusting stroke colors and UI aesthetics for both light and dark modes.
- **Animated Workflow States**: Leverages `AnimatePresence` and `layoutId` to smoothly morph between `idle`, `drawing`, and `done` states, maintaining visual continuity.
- **Premium Interaction Design**: Built with sophisticated spring transitions (`stiffness: 400`, `damping: 30`) and tactile hover/tap states for a responsive, high-end experience.
- **Effortless Clear & Redo**: Features smooth transitions for clearing the canvas and re-entering the drawing state, ensuring a friction-less user experience.
- **Callback-Driven Export**: Automatically provides a high-resolution base64 data URL via the `onFinish` callback, making it easy to save or transmit signature data.
