# Dropdown Disclosure

A premium selection component that uses Framer Motion's shared layout animations to transition seamlessly between a collapsed trigger and an expanded selection menu.

- **Shared Layout Transitions**: The trigger morphs into the menu container using the `layoutId` prop, providing a cohesive feel.
- **Spring-Action Menu**: Uses high-stiffness springs for responsive and snappy interactions.
- **Model Selection UI**: Designed specifically for AI model selection, with support for icons, descriptions, and "Upgrade" badges.
- **Click-Outside Handling**: Automatically closes when clicking outside the component.
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle checkmark and focus animations for state feedback.
