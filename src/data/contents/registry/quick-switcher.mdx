# Quick Switcher

A high-performance, dual-mode action bar designed for rapid context switching. It combines a tactile mode selector with a dynamic input field, using unified spring physics for a seamless experience.

- **Dynamic Icon Stacking**: Mode icons enter and exit with coordinated vertical motion, providing clear visual feedback of the active state.
- **Unified Spring Animation**: Inputs and icons share a consistent spring configuration, ensuring that layout changes feel organic and responsive.
- **Micro-Interaction Arrows**: Persistent indicator arrows highlight the active mode during the toggle transition, guided by high-contrast visual cues.
- **Blur & Depth Visuals**: Features a subtle "pop-layout" input animation with integrated blur effects for a premium, anti-gravity experience.
- **Tactile Execution Button**: Includes a dedicated action trigger with spring-based scaling, optimized for touch and mouse interactions.
