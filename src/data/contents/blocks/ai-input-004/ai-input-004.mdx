# AI Input 004

An adaptive and highly visual AI input component that dynamically transforms its layout while offering state-aware feedback and a premium background aesthetic.

- **Adaptive Fluid Layout** - Seamlessly transforms from a single-line input to a multi-row interface upon text entry.
- **Floating State Animations** - Dynamic "Generating" notifications that float and fade based on the application state.
- **Animated Canvas** - A living background with slow-moving radial gradients for a modern, tactile feel.
- **Interconnected States** - Integrated support for `IDLE`, `GENERATING`, and `RESULT` states with corresponding visual transitions.
- **Polished Micros** - Smooth button reveals, auto-resizing textareas, and spring-based motion handling.
